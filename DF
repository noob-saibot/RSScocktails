 CHAMPAGNE CONCOCTIONS-
 Park Avenue Potions
 ole Porter said, ""I get no kick from cham-Cpagne."" But what did he know? Cham-pagne fizzes with dizzying expectations and golden giddiness. Put simply: champagne
 makes people happy. Often associated with the beautiful and famous, champagne cocktails can be decadently expensive and devilishly delightful, especially when mixed with lavish liqueurs. So get the party started with a little champagne. Even if it's not a vintage Rothschild, bubbly inevitably transforms the most humdrum Herbert or Harriet into a shooting star.

 MARTINI MADNESS-
 Bond and Babe Drinks
 efore Bradshaw, Carrie Bradshaw, there Bwas Bond, James Bond, asking for his cho-sen drink, shaken not stirred. Smooth and suave, not to mention sexy as sin, James Bond was the quintessential martini drinker; in his first twenty films, the super spy drank eighteen. Bond owned the drink until a sex writer from Manhattan wooed the young and hip masses with fruitful neon twists on the classic. Soon, Sex and the City wannabees were teetering in expen-sive stilettos and ordering designer 'tinis in sleek bars from coast to coast. If ever a cocktail person-ified sex and status, it's the martini in all of its
 glorious renditions from past to present.

 SHOTS AND SLAMMERS FOR THE PERPETUAL 21-YEAR-OLD-
 Sorority and Fraternity Fantasia
 dmit it. You'd order a shot called a Blow AJob in college and snicker about it for days. Even brag about it. You know you would. But would you order that drink when you
 were thirty-five? Only if you were in the midst of a midlife crisis, craving a college-aged cutie, and a red sports car. We can't promise you the car or the girl, but, no question, these shots and slammers will send you down memory lane. Some of them flame. Literally. Some even wiggle, thanks to Jell-O. Down a couple-or four-with lethal names like Kamikaze and Alien Secretion, and you'll rocket to Mars faster than anything NASA could invent. Remember to buckle up!

 VINTAGE COCKTAILS-
 Gone but Not Forgotten
 or every generation, there's a drink that Fraises some eyebrows. In the 1980s, it was Sex on the Beach. In the 1930s, it was Sym-phony of Moist Joy. Sometimes, a drink lives on through the decades and becomes a classic. Other times, a simply fantastic drink fades away only to be found in the yellowed pages of an antique cookbook collecting dust on your grandmother's shelf. Many cocktails were named after Holly-wood starlets and notorious rogues who drank at popular Los Angeles haunts in the heyday of silver screen glamour. Many cocktails created before the Prohibition were certainly not for the faint of heart  and  included  absinthe,  the  legendary liqueur which was later made illegal in the United States. Don't fear-absinthe substitutes remain,
 but heed this warning: One common theme runs through the drinks of the first half of the twenti-eth century-heavy on the alcohol, easy on the mixer.

 TEMPTING TIPPLES FOR FESTIVE FROLICS-
 'Tis the Season
 our friend calls and insists that you throw Ya Fourth of July party. She suggests you serve more than beer and wine this time.
 The creative stakes are high but not impossible. Move beyond the traditional drinks for summer celebrations, yuletide gatherings, and even Easter events. Try a funky cocktail called The Betsy Ross for Independence Day or The Black Turncoat for a Cinco de Mayo bash. For the most romantic holi-day of the year-Valentine's Day-think outside the champagne and chocolate box. Wow your honey with a glass of Red Hot Passion or a Soul Kiss, sure to make the heart, and senses, melt. Often, traditional holidays like Christmas call for traditional drinks like eggnog and wassail, but you can add an international twist to the family feast
 by introducing the German ""Gluhwein."" Bottoms up!

 CURES WITHOUT CUSSING-
 The Morning After
 ore has it that next door to the Economist Loffices in London is a famed and very old-fashioned chemist-D. R. Harris. The shop has a most marvelous hangover cure, which those
 in need can buy in a bottle or tincture, or better yet, freshly mixed right there by the chemist for a pound note. Every morning, a procession of old gents in pin-striped suits hustle up to the counter for relief. The bufferest of all old buffers. Those of us, not privy to such European remedies can make our own. All that's needed: The ability to stand and mix.
